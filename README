rubycomplete is an omni-completion script for ruby. 
It supports the following:
  * dynamic completion of in-buffer entities (classes, methods, objects, modules).
  * rails 
          - inclusion of column-names/fields
          - helpers included in completions
  * automatic inclusion of required modules
  * automatic handling of syntax errors

Rubycomplete requires ruby support to work. It uses ruby to process the buffer and introspection to create a list of completions. 
It is distributed with vim, and as part of the vim-ruby project (http://vim-ruby.rubyforge.org/).
CVS versions are availible from vim-ruby, major releases will be published here and on my site.
